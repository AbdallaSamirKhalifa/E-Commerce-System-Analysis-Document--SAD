# E-Commerce-System-Analysis-Document--SAD

This repository contains the **functional analysis**, **UML diagrams**, and **high - level technical documentation** for an E-Commerce system based on a clean, requirements-driven workflow.

The goal of this project is to build the system **incrementally**, using a  
_User Story → Requirements → Flowchart → Sequence Diagram → Implementation_ approach.

This repo **does NOT contain backend or frontend code**.  
It focuses exclusively on documenting how the system should work.
